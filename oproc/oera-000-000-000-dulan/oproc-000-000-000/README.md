# OPROC-0: Decentralized Consequence
- **Authors:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

## Summary
Ordered Atomic Collaboration is a paradigm for decentralized consequence. OAC differs from traditional and popular decentralized and distributed compute in its emphasis on structures for penalization as opposed to perfect consensus. We believe OAC can be used to carefully to replace traditional DLT applications. However, OAC's long-term ambitions lie in the decentralized coordination of swarms. 

## Proclamation
Ordered Atomic Collaboration is a paradigm for decentralized consequence. 

OAC imagines a technological future wherein the value of secure compute over shared state is understood not in terms of participation for gain--but in terms of economies rendered against maliciousness. These economies form consequence from decentralized participation; they induce order which becomes preferential to disorder.

### Why OAC?
OAC is ordered atomic collaboration:
- OAC is **ordered** because it deals with the class of programs over shared state which must be properly ordered to compute secure state transitions. 
- OAC is **atomic** because these state transitions must either always complete or always fail. 
- OAC is **collaborative** because it seeks decentralized participation to produce economics against maliciousness. 

### How do OAC's objectives differ from existing technologies?
OAC skews away from traditional and popular decentralized and distributed compute in several ways:

#### I1: Large footprint
OAC focuses on large footprint systems--with the ambition of deriving greater performance and security. 

#### I2: BFA
OAC reduces networked compute to a more permissive class of protocols known as [BFA](../../../oart/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oart-000-000-001-bfa/README.md)--protocols allowing byzantine faults with some known error rate. 

#### I3: Expanded Incentivization
OAC aims to move the problem of incentivization and costliness out from the stake- and work-based systems of today to a broader class of economic structures. 

#### I4: Pipelining and Exotic Task Distribution
OAC seeks to maximize pipelining of compute to drive performance and increase opportunities for participation. 

#### I5: Penalty-driven
OAC de-emphasizes perfect consensus. The primary motive of OAC is to track states and generate incentives that make it easy to enforce penalties against malicious actors--and thus provide economies for machines. 

To analogize, it's not about making a farmer rely on the government to grow his crops. It's about the farmer being able to work with the government to petition against a neighbor encroaching on his land.

The clear, direct needs and safety must still be satisfied by individual actors. However, that these individual actors recognize individual benefits of collaborative action renders a system wherein expected behavior is safer. 

### What would be built with OAC?
We believe OAC can replace traditional and popular decentralized and distributed when used carefully. However, OAC's long-term ambitions lie in machine-to-machine communication. We believe OAC can be used to help solve challenging problems in AI alignment, dPIN verification, and decentralized swarm coordination.
