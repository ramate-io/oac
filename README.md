Ordered Atomic Collaboration (OAC) is a paradigm for decentralized consequence. 

OAC also refers to the organization which manages this repository. 

Currently, OAC is governed by [Ramate LLC](ramate.io). Likewise all implementations of OAC protocols are found under Ramate LLC's [`robles`](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) project.

OAC is intended as implementation agnostic. Before contributing to this repository, consider whether your intents are implementation specific by reviewing the following: 


## Organization 
- [`oera`](./oera): OAC Eras (OERA) are the periods over which a governing body makes decisions. All other OAC artifacts are indexed by OERA. 
- [`ogloss`](./ogloss/): OAC Glosses (OGLOSS) are defined terms for OAC. 
- [`oproc`](./opurp/): OAC Proclamations (OPROC) are statements of purpose for OAC.

- [`odes`](./odes/): OAC Desiderata (ODES) describe wants, open problems, and similar within the OAC paradigm. 
- [`ores`](./ores): OAC Resolutions (ORES) describe resolutions to ODES. Generally, contributors should use ORES to justify non-trivial changes to this repository. 
- [`oart`](./oart/): OAC Articles (OART) are academic papers which form the conceptual backbone of the OAC paradigm. 
- [`oroad`](./oroad/): OAC Roadmaps (OROAD) are roadmaps describing the intents and objectives of the OAC organization.
