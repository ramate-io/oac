# OGUIDE-0: Welcome to OAC in the Dulan Era!
- **Authors:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

OAC is just beginning as a project! We use a system for grouping work by periods we call [OAC Eras (OERA)](../../../oera/). The current era is [OERA-0: Dulan](../../../oera/oera-000-000-000-dulan/README.md) and is our very first. 

To kick off the **Dulan Era**, we made a proclamation about our intent to build systems of "decentralized consequence" called [OPROC-0: Decentralized Consequence](../../../oproc/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oproc-000-000-000/README.md). This proclamation is key to understanding the motives behind this project. Read it!

From [OPROC-0: Decentralized Consequence](../../../oproc/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oproc-000-000-000/README.md), we produced a roadmap, [OROAD-0: The Attempt](../../../oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md), for validating the foundational concepts of the project. We recommend you read [OROAD-0: The Attempt](../../../oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md) to understand how the project is being pursued. 

Once you've familiarized yourself with [OPROC-0: Decentralized Consequence](../../../oproc/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oproc-000-000-000/README.md) and [OROAD-0: The Attempt](../../../oroad/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oroad-000-000-000/README.md), take the time to read through the [OART index](../../../oart/). OAC is a conceptually oriented project--intended almost like a journal or academic institution; OART are our key conceptual outputs. 

Once you've done the above, you should have a strong enough sense of the project to explore at will! Welcome aboard!

## Agreeing
- **[AGR-1: Liam Monninger](./agreeing/agr-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that guide describes the exploratory nature of this initial phase well ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).

## Dissenting
- **[DIS-1: Liam Monninger](./dissenting/dis-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the guide does not make it clear how to participate ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).
