# OGOV-0: Founding
- **Authors:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

## Summary

## Continuity 
As the first OGOV, this document does not establish continuity with any previous regime. 

## Measures

### M1: The objects of governance are [Artifacts](../../../oglo/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md).
The governing body SHALL make decisions on the inclusion of [Artifacts](../../../oglo/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md) in this repository. This inclusion SHALL take the form of accepting PRs which add to the artifact set. The [Artifacts](../../oglo/oera-000-000-000-dulan/oglo-000-000-000-artifact/README.md) on the `main` branch of this repository SHALL be regarded as included. 

### M2: [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) is the governing body.
[Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL retain the right to make decisions pursuant to [M1](#m1-artifacts-are-the-objects-of-governance) as it sees fit.

> Currently, [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) decision making with respect to OAC is delegate by [RAGOV](https://github.com/ramate-io/ramate/tree/main/ragov) to the [`robles`](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) project under [ROGOV](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles/tree/main/rogov). 

## Interpretations
We assert there is no precedence for interpretation owing to the lack of [continuity](#continuity).

## Agreeing
- **[AGR-1: Liam Monninger](./agreeing/agr-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the delegation to [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) suits this early developmental phase ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).

## Dissenting
- **[DIS-1: Liam Monninger](./dissenting/dis-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the stipulations on [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) internal governance are too light ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).
