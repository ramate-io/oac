# OGOV-0: Founding
- **Authors:** [Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)

## Summary

## Continuity 
As the first OGOV, this document does not establish continuity with any previous regime. 

## Measures

### M1: Artifacts are the objects of governance
The governing body SHALL make decisions on the inclusion of artifacts in this repository. This inclusion SHALL take the form of accepting PRs which add to the artifact set. The artifacts on the `main` branch of this repository SHALL be regarded as included. 

### M2: [Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) as the governing body
[Ramate LLC](https://www.ramate.io) SHALL retain the rite to make decisions pursuant to [M1](#m1-artifacts-are-the-objects-of-governance) as it sees fit.

> Currently, [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) decision making with respect to OAC is delegate by [RAGOV](https://github.com/ramate-io/ramate/tree/main/ragov) to the [`robles`](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles) project under [ROGOV](https://github.com/ramate-io/robles/tree/main/rogov). 

## Interpretations
We assert there is no precedence for interpretation owing to the lack of [continuity](#continuity).

## Agreeing
- **[AGR-1: Liam Monninger](./agreeing/agr-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the delegation to [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) suits this early developmental phase ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).

## Dissenting
- **[DIS-1: Liam Monninger](./dissenting/dis-001-liam-monninger/README.md):** argues that the stipulations on [Ramate LLC's](https://www.ramate.io) internal governance are too light ([Liam Monninger](mailto:liam@ramate.io)).
